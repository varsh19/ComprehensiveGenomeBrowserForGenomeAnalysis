# ComprehensiveGenomeBrowserForGenomeAnalysis

This project was done as part of the "CSE 6242 - Data and Visual Analytics" course at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Fall 2023 semester.

We developed a user-friendly genome browser that extends the capabilities of similar software and incorporates current state-of-the-art downstream analyses and plugins for a cohesive, integrative experience. Our proposed tool will offer a much more intuitive user experience, plug-ins for the integration of several types of large biological datasets, and an all-in-one type approach to the standard practice, aligning with the principles of human-computer interaction.
